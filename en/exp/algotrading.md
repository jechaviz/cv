# Senior Algotrading & Quantitative Development Consultant
**Freelance / Own Projects** – International (Switzerland, Canada, Mexico)
**2019 – Present**

### Context
Quantitative Trading focused on algorithmic innovation, the design, development, and optimization of algorithmic trading systems for financial markets

### Purpose of the Position
Develop profitable, self-improving trading systems with measurable behavior by design, ensuring **equity trading** governance, signal engine modularization, and automated parameter optimization.

### Cross-cutting Responsibilities
* **Multilogic Architecture:** Design of decoupled systems based on **interfaces and implementations** to handle various market logics simultaneously.
* **Specialized Engines:** Development of interchangeable core engines:
    * **Signal Engines:** Abstraction of entry/exit logics.
    * **Staking Engines:** Advanced position management and capital allocation.
    * **Governance Engines:** Risk control, operational limits, and compliance with equity rules.
    * **Opportunity Cost Engines:** Dynamic analysis for trade prioritization.
* **Advanced Optimization:** Use of ***Optuna*** for hyper-parameter tuning and strategy optimization, minimizing overfitting and maximizing robustness.
* **Multibroker Development:** Creation of Expert Advisors (EAs) in ***MQL5*** (MetaTrader 5) for real-world execution and rapid prototyping of indicators in ***PineScript*** (TradingView) as a visual strategy laboratory.
* **Development Pipeline:** Robust three-stage methodology:
    1.  **Visual Lab** (***PineScript***): Prototyping and visual validation of market hypotheses.
    2.  **Quantitative Analysis** (***Python***): Deep modeling, statistical backtesting, and optimization with ***Optuna***.
    3.  **Real Execution** (***MQL5***): Implementation of the engine architecture for live trading.


### RELEVANT PROJECTS

#### Project 1: Optimization and Prediction Framework
**Period:** 2019 - Present

**Objective:** Develop a trading framework that uses mathematical analysis to predict movements and optimize results through stochastic processes.

**Achievements:** Stabilization of the equity curve through the implementation of volatility filters and continuous optimization with ***Optuna***.

**Technologies / Tools:**
`Python` · `Optuna` · `SciPy` · `Scikit-learn` · `Nautilus Trading`

#### Project 2: Modular Signal Engines & Risk Management (MQL5)
**Period:** 2019 - Present

**Objective:** Create a trading system where risk management is independent of signal generation for real-world execution.

**Achievements:** Implementation of strict governance over capital and modularity for the agile integration of logics previously validated in the ***PineScript*** laboratory.

**Technologies / Tools:**
`MQL5` · `PineScript` · `Python (aiomql)` · `MetaTrader 5` · `Nautilus Trading` · `Quantitative Development`
