As a **Full Stack expert**, I have designed and led the implementation of robust ecosystems using **Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, React, and Vue**, ensuring symmetry between business vision and technical excellence.

My trajectory includes a high-specialization track in **Algotrading and Quantitative Development** since 2019, holding strategic roles such as Technical Manager and Multistack Architect in global corporate environments and international consultancy.
